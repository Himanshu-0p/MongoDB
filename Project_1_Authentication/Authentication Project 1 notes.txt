Authentication Project 1 notes:

Before we understand Authentication are 4things we need to understand:
1.Hashing
2.Encryption
3.JSON web tokens
4.Local Storage

1.Hashing: 
  It converts your password into gibberish/some bytes that cannot be understood

2.Encryption:
  It also converts your password into a gibberish that cannot be understood but with the key which 
  is a very secrete key we can convert gibberish to password.
  Means Encryption is two way whereas the Hashing is one-way.

3.JSON Web Token
  Its neither of encryption or hashing (its technically a digital signature)
  Anyone can see the original output given the signature
  Signature can be verified only using the password

Question: Difference between parse and safe parse
If want to throw an exception u use parse and if u don't want to throw an exception but success true or false then safe parse it is

IMP:1.JWT is used to create Token
    2.User get back a token after the signin request
    3.User send backs tokens in all authenticated request
